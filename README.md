## Installation

```bash
cd $PATH_TO_YOUR_BENCH
bench get-app https://github.com/BuildWithHussain/vms --branch develop
bench --site your-site.localhost install-app vms
bench build
bench --site your-site.localhost migrate
```

## Configuration

### Cloudflare R2 Setup

VMS stores all media files in a Cloudflare R2 bucket. You need to configure R2 credentials before uploading.

1. **Create an R2 bucket** in your [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) (e.g. `vms-media`)

2. **Create R2 API tokens** at Cloudflare Dashboard > R2 > Manage R2 API Tokens:
   - Create a token with **Object Read & Write** permission for your bucket
   - Note the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**

3. **Configure VMS** by navigating to Settings > General in the VMS app (or via Frappe desk at VMS Settings):

   | Field | Description |
   |-------|-------------|
   | Account ID | Your Cloudflare account ID (found in dashboard URL) |
   | Access Key ID | R2 API token access key |
   | Secret Access Key | R2 API token secret |
   | Bucket Name | Your R2 bucket name (e.g. `vms-media`) |
   | Public URL | *(Optional)* Custom domain or R2 public bucket URL for CDN access |
   | Cloudflare API Token | *(Optional)* For bucket usage stats — create at My Profile > API Tokens |

4. Click **Test Connection** to verify your credentials

### Upload Settings

In the same General settings tab you can configure:

- **Max File Size (MB)** — Default: 5120 MB (5 GB)
- **Presigned URL Expiry** — Default: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- **Allowed Extensions** — Comma-separated list (e.g. `mp4,mov,avi,mkv,webm`)

### FFmpeg (for Thumbnails)

VMS uses FFmpeg to extract video thumbnails. Install it on your server:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

# macOS
brew install ffmpeg
```

## Development

cd apps/vms/frontend
yarn install
yarn dev       # Vite dev server on localhost:8080
yarn build     # Build to vms/public/frontend/
yarn lint      # ESLint + Prettier
yarn typecheck # vue-tsc
```

### Backend

```bash
bench start                                    # Start dev server
bench --site your-site run-tests --app vms     # Run unit tests
