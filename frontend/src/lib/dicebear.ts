 * when it is set, and everything falls back to the icon when it is not.
 *
 * Two rules shape this file.
 *
 * Generation is local. `@dicebear/core` renders the SVG in the browser, so a
 * project row never reaches `api.dicebear.com` — this app is served from a
 * Frappe site and must not hand a third party the list of projects a user is
 * looking at, once per row, forever.
 *
 * Generation is also lazy. The twelve style definitions weigh ~1.2 MB of JSON
 * and the renderer another ~120 kB; that is far more than the rest of the
 * frontend and it is only ever needed while the picker is open. Every entry
 * point here is `async` and reaches the packages through `import()`, so Rollup
 * splits them into chunks that the app loads on the first shuffle and never
 * before. Nothing in this module may be imported for its side effects.
